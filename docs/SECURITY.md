# Security

AI Cost Guard is intentionally local-first.

## No Content Logging By Default

Usage records store metadata only:

- timestamp
- client
- model alias
- upstream
- estimated input and output chars
- estimated tokens
- estimated cost
- budget action
- rule or security event

Prompts and responses are not stored by default.

## Keys Stay Local

API keys live in `~/.costguard/.env` or in the path selected by `COSTGUARD_HOME`. `.env` is ignored by Git.

Pricing catalog endpoints and API keys are local workstation configuration. Do not commit company-specific `COSTGUARD_PRICING_URL` values, real API keys, or screenshots/logs that reveal them. Prefer `COSTGUARD_PRICING_API_KEY_ENV` or `--api-key-env` so keys stay in environment variables.

## Localhost Proxy

The proxy binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. If another host is selected, Cost Guard prints a warning.

## Claude Code Backups

Before modifying Claude Code settings, Cost Guard writes a backup next to `settings.json`:

```text
settings.json.bak.costguard-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
```

Uninstall restores from the latest clean backup when available, ignores backups that already contain Cost Guard fragments, and removes Cost Guard backup files after successful cleanup. A localhost `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` alone is not treated as Cost Guard; existing user config still gets backed up before setup changes it.

Claude Code setup should be tested first with `COSTGUARD_CLAUDE_HOME` pointing to an isolated `.tmp` directory. Do not modify real `~/.claude/settings.json` without explicit user approval.

The official Claude Code VS Code plugin may not use the same settings path or environment variables as Claude Code CLI. Treat it as unvalidated until a licensed user confirms it can route through the local Cost Guard proxy.

## Reversible Uninstall

`costguard uninstall` restores Claude Code settings from backup or removes only Cost Guard fragments. It keeps Cost Guard home by default. `--purge --yes` is required to delete the local Cost Guard home.

## Secret Blocking

Default rules block:

- `.env`
- private keys
- Terraform state and vars
- secret-like, password-like, credential-like, and token-like paths
- commands such as `env`, `printenv`, and `cat .env`

The proxy also blocks payloads that look like private keys or API key assignments when the secret filter is enabled.

## Cache Risks

Cache is disabled by default. Basic response cache is also metadata-only until `COSTGUARD_CACHE_STORE_CONTENT=true` is set locally.

When content storage is enabled, Cost Guard stores full cached response bodies and enough request-derived data to replay exact matches under `cache/responses/`. It does not store API keys or request headers, but prompts and responses can still contain sensitive business context. Enable it only on trusted local workstations, do not use it with secrets, and do not commit cache files.

Response cache has TTL, max-entry, max-size, and eviction controls. These controls reduce local footprint but are not a substitute for data classification: do not cache secrets, client data, credentials, tokens, `.env` content, or sensitive screenshots/logs.

`cache/models.json` is the pricing catalog cache and is separate from response cache. `costguard cache clear` preserves pricing cache by default; delete it only with `--pricing` or `--pricing-only`.

Semantic/vector cache is scaffolded only; embeddings are not active in the base solution.

## Headroom Risks

Headroom can transform request payloads before they reach the upstream model. It is disabled by default and requires the optional `headroom-ai` package or a compatible local adapter. Review Headroom's data handling, model downloads, local cache behavior, and corporate TLS requirements before enabling it in a work environment.

## Do Not Commit Secrets

Never commit:

- `.env`
- `~/.costguard`
- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- keys, tokens, Terraform state, or local cache data
