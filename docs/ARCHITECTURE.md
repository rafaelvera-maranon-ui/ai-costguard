# Architecture

AI Cost Guard is a local proxy plus a small set of local controls.

## Cline Flow

```text
VS Code -> Cline -> http://127.0.0.1:4040/v1 -> Cost Guard -> OpenAI-compatible upstream
```

Cline is configured manually:

```text
Provider: OpenAI Compatible
Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:4040/v1
API Key: sk-costguard-local
Model ID: cg-standard
```

Cost Guard maps `cg-*` aliases to upstream OpenAI-compatible model names from `.env`.

## Claude Code Flow

```text
VS Code -> Claude Code -> http://127.0.0.1:4040 -> Cost Guard -> Anthropic-compatible upstream
```

Claude Code is configured by merging Cost Guard environment variables and hooks into `settings.json`. Existing settings are preserved and a backup is created first when the file is not already instrumented by Cost Guard.

## Where Cost Guard Lives

End-user files live under `~/.costguard`:

```text
.env
costguard.db
config/settings.yaml
config/pricing.yaml
rules/default.yaml
rules/user.yaml
hooks/
bin/
logs/
cache/
vector_cache/
backups/
```

For isolated development, `COSTGUARD_HOME` replaces `~/.costguard` and `COSTGUARD_CLAUDE_HOME` replaces `~/.claude`.

## Why It Does Not Touch Client Repos

Cost Guard is designed as an external local guard. It does not modify a project by default. The only project-level command is `costguard attach --project <name>`, which creates `.claude/settings.local.json` and excludes it via `.git/info/exclude`.

## Why SQLite, Not Postgres

SQLite is local, file-based, zero-service, and enough for usage metadata, budget checks, and audit events. It keeps setup simple and avoids Docker or managed infrastructure.

## Pricing Catalog

Cost Guard ships with fallback local cost estimates so the budget feature works without a corporate pricing service. For real deployments, configure `COSTGUARD_PRICING_URL` in `.env` and run `costguard pricing refresh`. The refresh reads a generic model catalog with fields such as `name`, `systemName`, `inputPrice`, and `outputPrice`, then stores normalized prices in `config/pricing.yaml`.

This is intentionally provider-neutral. A company can point Cost Guard at its own OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, Bedrock-backed, or internal GenAI catalog as long as it exposes model names and input/output prices. Provider quotas and HTTP 429 responses remain upstream controls; Cost Guard budget remains a local policy.

## Semantic Cache

The semantic/vector cache is optional. It is intended to store safe summaries and metadata so repeated repository context, docs, errors, logs, or large files do not need to be resent. It does not replace SQLite, and it is disabled by default.

The MVP includes commands and local storage structure. A vector engine can be added later behind the same interface.

## Headroom

Headroom is an optional request compression layer. It is not a core dependency and is disabled by default. When enabled, Cost Guard imports the Python module installed by `headroom-ai` and applies it after the local secret filter and model alias mapping, but before budget estimation and upstream forwarding.

The preferred integration is the official library API:

- `compress(messages, model=...)`

Cost Guard passes the request `messages` list and the already-resolved upstream model name, then writes the returned `result.messages` back into the payload. For local/custom adapters, Cost Guard also supports these payload-level functions:

- `compress_payload(payload, ...)`
- `compress_request(payload, ...)`
- `transform_payload(payload, ...)`
- `apply(payload, ...)`

Payload-level functions may return a transformed payload dictionary or mutate the payload in place. Cost Guard passes optional `client` and `home` context when the adapter accepts it. If Headroom is enabled but no compatible adapter is available, the proxy fails with a clear local error rather than silently bypassing compression.

## Proxy MVP

The proxy exposes:

- `/health`
- `/v1/chat/completions` for OpenAI-compatible Cline traffic
- `/v1/messages` for Anthropic-compatible Claude Code traffic

It validates the local API key, applies a basic secret filter, checks budgets, maps model aliases, estimates cost from local pricing or fallback settings, forwards to the configured upstream, applies output limits where possible, and stores metadata in SQLite.

## Limitations

- Cost estimates are approximate.
- Streaming support is not implemented in the MVP.
- Semantic cache is scaffolded, not a full vector implementation.
- Headroom requires a compatible external adapter; no adapter is bundled in the base package.
- Cline still requires manual configuration.
- Upstream-specific edge cases may need adapter improvements.
