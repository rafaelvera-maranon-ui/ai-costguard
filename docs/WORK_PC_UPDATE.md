# Update ai-costguard On A Work PC

This procedure updates a local `ai-costguard` checkout on a corporate PC when the code is distributed through a company fork.

Recommended flow:

```text
Personal/original repo updated
  -> Sync fork in company GitHub
  -> git pull in local company checkout
  -> uv sync
  -> offline validations
```

## 1. Goal

Update `ai-costguard` on a corporate PC without modifying client repositories, without touching real local configuration unnecessarily, and without consuming LLM tokens.

The validations in this document are offline: they check the CLI, rules, environment, tests, and local state. They should not call Cline, Claude Code, or Generative Engine.

## 2. Assumptions

- The company local checkout is in a folder similar to:

```text
C:\Users\<user>\...\Github\AI\ai-costguard
```

- `origin` points to the company fork, not necessarily to the personal/original repo.
- The company fork is synchronized from GitHub web using `Sync fork`.
- The project is managed with `uv`.
- Do not use `pip` directly for this update flow.
- Do not run this procedure inside a client repository such as `databricks-free-lab`.

## 3. Sync The Company Fork

1. Open the company fork of `ai-costguard` in GitHub.
2. Click `Sync fork`.
3. Click `Update branch`.
4. Confirm that the fork is up to date with the personal/original repo.

You do not need to configure a local upstream remote for this flow. The fork is synchronized from GitHub web to keep the work-PC procedure simple and less error-prone.

## 4. Update The Local Checkout

Open PowerShell and move to the local `ai-costguard` checkout, not to a client repo:

```powershell
Set-Location "PATH_TO_REPO\ai-costguard"

git remote -v
git status
git branch --show-current

git fetch origin --prune
git pull --ff-only origin main
git log --oneline -10
```

Expected evidence:

- `origin` points to the company fork.
- The active branch is `main`.
- `git status` shows no pending local changes before the update.
- `git pull --ff-only origin main` completes without a manual merge.
- `git log --oneline -10` shows the expected recent commits.

If `git pull --ff-only` fails because of local changes, do not run `git reset --hard` without a backup and without understanding which changes would be lost.

## 5. Stop CostGuard Before Updating The Environment

Before recreating `.venv`, stop CostGuard if it was running:

```powershell
costguard stop

Get-Process python,uv,costguard -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Name,Id,Path
```

How to interpret this:

- If no processes are returned, you can continue.
- If `python`, `costguard`, or `uv` processes are returned, they may be locking `.venv`.
- Do not kill processes blindly. Check the `Path` value and confirm they belong to this repo or to CostGuard before closing them.

## 6. Recreate A Clean uv Environment

From the local `ai-costguard` checkout:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\.venv

uv sync --extra dev --extra headroom
```

We recreate the environment cleanly because real work-PC testing showed that it avoids inconsistent environments, `missing RECORD file`, half-installed packages, and `Access denied` errors.

Expected evidence:

- Output equivalent to `Creating virtual environment at: .venv`.
- Packages are installed from the local project.
- `ai-costguard` is installed from a path like `file:///.../ai-costguard`.
- `headroom-ai` is installed when the `headroom` extra is used.
- No `missing RECORD file` warnings appear.
- No `Access denied` errors appear.

If `Remove-Item` fails, go back to the previous section and check for live processes.

## 7. Validate The Updated CLI

```powershell
uv run costguard --help
```

Expected commands:

- `setup`
- `start`
- `stop`
- `status`
- `doctor`
- `cline-config`
- `budget`
- `rules`
- `usage`
- `cache`
- `headroom`
- `pricing`

If `costguard` is not available globally, use `uv run costguard ...` from inside the repo and avoid mixing it with older global installations.

## 8. Offline Validations Without Consuming Tokens

These validations should not call LLMs or consume Generative Engine quota:

```powershell
uv run pytest

uv run costguard rules test "cat .env"
uv run costguard rules test "git diff"
uv run costguard rules test "find ."

uv run costguard pricing --help
uv run costguard pricing refresh --help
uv run costguard pricing status

uv run costguard headroom status
uv run costguard cache status
```

Expected evidence:

- `pytest` passes.
- `cat .env` is blocked.
- `git diff` and `find .` are rewritten to smaller commands.
- `pricing status`, `headroom status`, and `cache status` show local state.

Do not test Cline against the model during this phase if quota is exhausted or if you only need to validate the local update.

## 9. Configure Pricing Catalog

CostGuard can optionally fetch and cache model prices from a provider model catalog. This does not consume LLM tokens because it calls a catalog endpoint, not chat/completions.

For the company Generative Engine model catalog discovered in the POC:

```text
GET https://models.example.com/v1/models
Header: x-api-key: <REDACTED>
```

Do not use the OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint as the pricing source:

```text
https://llm-gateway.example.com/v1
```

Use an environment variable for the key:

```powershell
$env:PRICING_API_KEY = "<REDACTED>"
```

Validate without writing files:

```powershell
uv run costguard pricing refresh --endpoint https://models.example.com/v1/models --api-key-env PRICING_API_KEY --auth-header x-api-key --dry-run
```

Refresh and cache locally:

```powershell
uv run costguard pricing refresh --endpoint https://models.example.com/v1/models --api-key-env PRICING_API_KEY --auth-header x-api-key
uv run costguard pricing status
```

Files written under `COSTGUARD_HOME`:

```text
<COSTGUARD_HOME>\config\pricing.yaml
<COSTGUARD_HOME>\cache\models.json
```

The API key is not written to those files. Do not paste real keys into chats, issues, logs, screenshots, or commits.

If no pricing catalog is configured or cached, CostGuard continues to use fallback estimates from `settings.yaml`.

## 10. Optional Isolated Validation

To validate `setup` without touching `~/.costguard`, `~/.claude`, or real Claude Code configuration, use temporary paths inside the repo:

```powershell
$env:COSTGUARD_HOME = "$(Get-Location)\.tmp\costguard"
$env:COSTGUARD_CLAUDE_HOME = "$(Get-Location)\.tmp\claude"

uv run costguard setup --tool cline --daily-budget 5 --monthly-budget 100 --budget-mode warn --non-interactive
uv run costguard doctor
uv run costguard status
uv run costguard cline-config
```

This isolated validation should not modify real Claude Code configuration. With `--tool cline`, CostGuard only prints Cline configuration and keeps the test inside `COSTGUARD_HOME`.

## 11. What Not To Do

- Do not run this procedure inside client repositories.
- Do not use `pip install` directly unless a specific runbook says so.
- Do not run `git reset --hard` without a backup.
- Do not edit `~/.claude/settings.json` without explicit confirmation.
- Do not paste secrets into terminals, issues, logs, or chats.
- Do not test Cline against the model if Generative Engine quota is exhausted.
- Do not use `Retry` in Cline when `payload blocked by secret filter` appears; use `Start New Task`.

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Case: `uv sync` Fails With `Access denied`

Stop CostGuard:

```powershell
costguard stop
```

Check processes:

```powershell
Get-Process python,uv,costguard -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Name,Id,Path
```

If there are no relevant processes, delete `.venv` and repeat `uv sync`:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\.venv
uv sync --extra dev --extra headroom
```

### Case: `missing RECORD file` Warning

Recreate `.venv` with `uv`:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\.venv
uv sync --extra dev --extra headroom
```

### Case: `pip` Does Not Exist In `.venv`

This is expected when the environment is managed with `uv`. Use:

```powershell
uv run costguard --help
uv run pytest
```

### Case: `429 true` From Cline

This is usually a Generative Engine provider limit or quota issue, not necessarily a CostGuard block.

Possible actions:

- Wait for quota reset.
- Change credentials or tier if applicable.
- Validate offline with `uv run pytest` and `costguard` commands without calling the model.

### Case: `payload blocked by secret filter`

This can be caused by accumulated Cline context.

Recommended actions:

- Open `Start New Task`.
- Try a minimal prompt such as `Say OK`.
- Do not use `Retry` as the first diagnostic step because it may resend the same accumulated context.
